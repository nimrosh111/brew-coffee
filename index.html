                A study of 2013 investigated changes in the physicochemical characteristics and coffee flavors of coffee
                beans under different roasting conditions. Four different kinds of roasted coffees were analyzed using a
                headspace gas chromatographic technique. The moisture content and total acidity of roasted coffee
                decreased whereas the pH and weight loss (%) increased, as coffee beans were roasted at higher
                temperatures. The Hunter is color values of the roasted coffee (indicating L (lightness) and b
                (yellowness)) decreased as the roasting temperature of the coffee beans increased, but a (redness) value
                only increased with light roasting. We also noted that the color of the Arabica coffee was darker than
                that of the Robusta coffee. The aroma compounds, acetaldehyde, acetone, 2-methylfuran, 2-methylbutanol,
                2-methylpyrazine, furfural, 2-propanone, furfuryl alcohol, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine and furfuryl acetate
                were mainly analyzed.

        <h1 class="h1"><i>TYPES</i></h1>
        <p>We’re a nation of coffee lovers, but when it comes to trying something new, our taste buds often prefer to
            stick to what we know and love. But, by staying to what you know, there’s a world of different coffee types
            you could be missing out on. So, what are different types coffee, and what do they taste like? </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li> What is an Americano?
                <p>An americano is quite simply just hot water and espresso. It’ll either be served 1/2 and 1/2 or 1/3
                    espresso to 2/3 water, depending on the coffee shop in question or how you’ve chosen to brew it.
                    There is dispute about whether the espresso or the water should be added first, but in the case of
                    the americano, espresso should always be added first as the crema mixes in and creates a more
                    mellow, even taste. But some people may add it depending on their personal preference. Whilst most
                    other espresso-based coffee drinks include milk, such as the cappuccino or latte, the americano
                    stands out amongst them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>What is a Cortado?
                <p>Unlike other coffee types the milk isn’t texturised and instead, Cortado coffee is made with lightly
                    steamed milk, no froth or foam. The steamed milk on top reduces the acidity of the coffee and
                    creates a micro-foam which doesn’t separate from the espresso, giving it a strong and rich flavour.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>What is a Mocha?
                <p>Although a mocha is often interpreted differently across the world, the basis is that a shot of
                    espresso is combined with a chocolate powder or syrup, followed by milk or cream. It is a variant of
                    a latte, in the sense that it is often 1/3 espresso and 2/3 steamed milk. However, a chocolate
                    flavour is added, and this can be milk or dark.</p>

            </li>
            <li>What is a Macchiato?
                <p>In Italian, the term "macchiato" translates as "marked" or "stained", meaning a stained or marked
                    coffee. The macchiato is an espresso coffee drink, topped with a small amount of foamed or steamed
                    milk to allow the taste of the espresso to still shine through</p>
            </li>
